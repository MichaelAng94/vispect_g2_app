However, we can read the signals of most cars. \nIf your ADAS succeeds on reading the turn signals from your car, it will not alarm when you turn on the turn lights and then change the lane.\n If you choose to skip this step, or you fail at this step, the ADAS will not be able to read the turn signals, thus it will alarm whenever you change the lane, no mater you have turned on the turn light or not.</string>
